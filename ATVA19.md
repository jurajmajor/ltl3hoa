=================

Please see the [Jupyter notebook](Experiments/Evaluation_ATVA19.ipnyb) with all results.

The following input data were used to evaluate the tools:

* [Set of 1000 random formulae](Experiments/formulae/atva19/rand.ltl)
* [Formulae from literature and scalable patterns](Experiments/formulae/atva19/patterns.ltl)

CSV files with the measured data are available:

* [Deterministic automata, random formulae](Experiments/formulae/atva19/det.rand.csv)
* [Deterministic automata, patterns](Experiments/formulae/atva19/det.patterns.csv)
* [Nondeterministic automata, random formulae](Experiments/formulae/atva19/nondet.rand.csv)
* [Nondeterministic automata, patterns](Experiments/formulae/atva19/nondet.patterns.csv)
